# philble-mqtt 

Does what it says on the lid, makes a Bluetooth-enabled Hue controllable over MQTT. More of a hack/PoC than a stable daemon, right now disconnects are not handled and there is no state feedback from the Hue. Big thanks to [@npaun for doing all the heavy lifting](https://github.com/npaun/philble). Tested with my Hue Go V2.
